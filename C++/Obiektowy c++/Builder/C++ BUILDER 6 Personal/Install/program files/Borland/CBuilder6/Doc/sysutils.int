{
        Signals

    External exceptions, or signals, are, by default, converted to language
    exceptions by the Delphi RTL.  Under Linux, a Delphi application installs
    signal handlers to trap the raw signals, and convert them.  Delphi libraries
    do not install handlers by default.  So if you are implementing a standalone
    library, such as an Apache DSO, and you want to have signals converted to
    language exceptions that you can catch, you must install signal hooks
    manually, using the interfaces that the Delphi RTL provides.

    For most libraries, installing signal handlers is pretty
    straightforward.  Call HookSignal(RTL_SIGDEFAULT) at initialization time,
    and UnhookSignal(RTL_SIGNALDEFAULT) at shutdown.  This will install handlers
    for a set of signals that the RTL normally hooks for Delphi applications.

    There are some cases where the above initialization will not work properly:
    The proper behaviour for setting up signal handlers is to set
    a signal handler, and then later restore the signal handler to its previous
    state when you clean up.  If you have two libraries lib1 and lib2, and lib1
    installs a signal handler, and then lib2 installs a signal handler, those
    libraries have to uninstall in the proper order if they restore signal
    handlers, or the signal handlers can be left in an inconsistent and
    potentially fatal state.  Not all libraries behave well with respect to
    installing signal handlers.  To hedge against this possibility, and allow
    you to manage signal handlers better in the face of whatever behaviour
    you may find in external libraries, we provide a set of four interfaces to
    allow you to tailor the Delphi signal handler hooking/unhooking in the
    event of an emergency.  These are:
        InquireSignal
        AbandonSignalHandler
        HookSignal
        UnhookSignal

    InquireSignal allows you to look at the state of a signal handler, so
    that you can find out if someone grabbed it out from under you.

    AbandonSignalHandler tells the RTL never to unhook a particular
    signal handler.  This can be used if you find a case where it would
    be unsafe to return to the previous state of signal handling.  For
    example, if the previous signal handler was installed by a library
    which has since been unloaded.

    HookSignal/UnhookSignal setup signal handlers that map certain signals
    into language exceptions.

    See additional notes at InquireSignal, et al, below.

{ Currency and date/time formatting options

  The initial values of these variables are fetched from the system registry
  using the GetLocaleInfo function in the Win32 API. The description of each
  variable specifies the LOCALE_XXXX constant used to fetch the initial
  value.

  CurrencyString - Defines the currency symbol used in floating-point to
  decimal conversions. The initial value is fetched from LOCALE_SCURRENCY.

  CurrencyFormat - Defines the currency symbol placement and separation
  used in floating-point to decimal conversions. Possible values are:

    0 = '$1'
    1 = '1$'
    2 = '$ 1'
    3 = '1 $'

  The initial value is fetched from LOCALE_ICURRENCY.

  NegCurrFormat - Defines the currency format for used in floating-point to
  decimal conversions of negative numbers. Possible values are:

    0 = '($1)'      4 = '(1$)'      8 = '-1 $'      12 = '$ -1'
    1 = '-$1'       5 = '-1$'       9 = '-$ 1'      13 = '1- $'
    2 = '$-1'       6 = '1-$'      10 = '1 $-'      14 = '($ 1)'
    3 = '$1-'       7 = '1$-'      11 = '$ 1-'      15 = '(1 $)'

  The initial value is fetched from LOCALE_INEGCURR.

  ThousandSeparator - The character used to separate thousands in numbers
  with more than three digits to the left of the decimal separator. The
  initial value is fetched from LOCALE_STHOUSAND.  A value of #0 indicates
  no thousand separator character should be output even if the format string
  specifies thousand separators.

  DecimalSeparator - The character used to separate the integer part from
  the fractional part of a number. The initial value is fetched from
  LOCALE_SDECIMAL.  DecimalSeparator must be a non-zero value.

  CurrencyDecimals - The number of digits to the right of the decimal point
  in a currency amount. The initial value is fetched from LOCALE_ICURRDIGITS.

  DateSeparator - The character used to separate the year, month, and day
  parts of a date value. The initial value is fetched from LOCATE_SDATE.

  ShortDateFormat - The format string used to convert a date value to a
  short string suitable for editing. For a complete description of date and
  time format strings, refer to the documentation for the FormatDate
  function. The short date format should only use the date separator
  character and the  m, mm, d, dd, yy, and yyyy format specifiers. The
  initial value is fetched from LOCALE_SSHORTDATE.

  LongDateFormat - The format string used to convert a date value to a long
  string suitable for display but not for editing. For a complete description
  of date and time format strings, refer to the documentation for the
  FormatDate function. The initial value is fetched from LOCALE_SLONGDATE.

  TimeSeparator - The character used to separate the hour, minute, and
  second parts of a time value. The initial value is fetched from
  LOCALE_STIME.

  TimeAMString - The suffix string used for time values between 00:00 and
  11:59 in 12-hour clock format. The initial value is fetched from
  LOCALE_S1159.

  TimePMString - The suffix string used for time values between 12:00 and
  23:59 in 12-hour clock format. The initial value is fetched from
  LOCALE_S2359.

  ShortTimeFormat - The format string used to convert a time value to a
  short string with only hours and minutes. The default value is computed
  from LOCALE_ITIME and LOCALE_ITLZERO.

  LongTimeFormat - The format string used to convert a time value to a long
  string with hours, minutes, and seconds. The default value is computed
  from LOCALE_ITIME and LOCALE_ITLZERO.

  ShortMonthNames - Array of strings containing short month names. The mmm
  format specifier in a format string passed to FormatDate causes a short
  month name to be substituted. The default values are fecthed from the
  LOCALE_SABBREVMONTHNAME system locale entries.

  LongMonthNames - Array of strings containing long month names. The mmmm
  format specifier in a format string passed to FormatDate causes a long
  month name to be substituted. The default values are fecthed from the
  LOCALE_SMONTHNAME system locale entries.

  ShortDayNames - Array of strings containing short day names. The ddd
  format specifier in a format string passed to FormatDate causes a short
  day name to be substituted. The default values are fecthed from the
  LOCALE_SABBREVDAYNAME system locale entries.

  LongDayNames - Array of strings containing long day names. The dddd
  format specifier in a format string passed to FormatDate causes a long
  day name to be substituted. The default values are fecthed from the
  LOCALE_SDAYNAME system locale entries.

  ListSeparator - The character used to separate items in a list.  The
  initial value is fetched from LOCALE_SLIST.

  TwoDigitYearCenturyWindow - Determines what century is added to two
  digit years when converting string dates to numeric dates.  This value
  is subtracted from the current year before extracting the century.
  This can be used to extend the lifetime of existing applications that
  are inextricably tied to 2 digit year data entry.  The best solution
  to Year 2000 (Y2k) issues is not to accept 2 digit years at all - require
  4 digit years in data entry to eliminate century ambiguities.

  Examples:

  Current TwoDigitCenturyWindow  Century  StrToDate() of:
  Year    Value                  Pivot    '01/01/03' '01/01/68' '01/01/50'

  -  an optional width specifier, [width]
  -  an optional precision specifier, ["." prec]
  -  the conversion type character, type

  The following conversion characters are supported:

  d  Decimal. The argument must be an integer value. The value is converted
     to a string of decimal digits. If the format string contains a precision
     specifier, it indicates that the resulting string must contain at least
     the specified number of digits; if the value has less digits, the
     resulting string is left-padded with zeros.

  u  Unsigned decimal.  Similar to 'd' but no sign is output.

  e  Scientific. The argument must be a floating-point value. The value is
     converted to a string of the form "-d.ddd...E+ddd". The resulting
     string starts with a minus sign if the number is negative, and one digit
     always precedes the decimal point. The total number of digits in the
     resulting string (including the one before the decimal point) is given
     by the precision specifer in the format string--a default precision of
     15 is assumed if no precision specifer is present. The "E" exponent
     character in the resulting string is always followed by a plus or minus
     sign and at least three digits.

  f  Fixed. The argument must be a floating-point value. The value is
     converted to a string of the form "-ddd.ddd...". The resulting string
     starts with a minus sign if the number is negative. The number of digits
     after the decimal point is given by the precision specifier in the
     format string--a default of 2 decimal digits is assumed if no precision
     specifier is present.

  g  General. The argument must be a floating-point value. The value is
     converted to the shortest possible decimal string using fixed or
     scientific format. The number of significant digits in the resulting
     string is given by the precision specifier in the format string--a
     default precision of 15 is assumed if no precision specifier is present.
     Trailing zeros are removed from the resulting string, and a decimal
     point appears only if necessary. The resulting string uses fixed point
     format if the number of digits to the left of the decimal point in the
     value is less than or equal to the specified precision, and if the
     value is greater than or equal to 0.00001. Otherwise the resulting
     string uses scientific format.

  n  Number. The argument must be a floating-point value. The value is
     converted to a string of the form "-d,ddd,ddd.ddd...". The "n" format
     corresponds to the "f" format, except that the resulting string
     contains thousand separators.

  m  Money. The argument must be a floating-point value. The value is
     converted to a string that represents a currency amount. The conversion
     is controlled by the CurrencyString, CurrencyFormat, NegCurrFormat,
     ThousandSeparator, DecimalSeparator, and CurrencyDecimals global
     variables, all of which are initialized from locale settings provided
     by the operating system.  For example, Currency Format preferences can be
     set in the International section of the Windows Control Panel. If the format
     string contains a precision specifier, it overrides the value given
     by the CurrencyDecimals global variable.

  p  Pointer. The argument must be a pointer value. The value is converted
     to a string of the form "XXXX:YYYY" where XXXX and YYYY are the
     segment and offset parts of the pointer expressed as four hexadecimal
     digits.

  s  String. The argument must be a character, a string, or a PChar value.
     The string or character is inserted in place of the format specifier.
     The precision specifier, if present in the format string, specifies the
     maximum length of the resulting string. If the argument is a string
     that is longer than this maximum, the string is truncated.

  x  Hexadecimal. The argument must be an integer value. The value is
     converted to a string of hexadecimal digits. If the format string
     contains a precision specifier, it indicates that the resulting string
     must contain at least the specified number of digits; if the value has
     less digits, the resulting string is left-padded with zeros.

  Conversion characters may be specified in upper case as well as in lower
  case--both produce the same results.

  For all floating-point formats, the actual characters used as decimal and
  thousand separators are obtained from the DecimalSeparator and
  ThousandSeparator global variables.

  Index, width, and precision specifiers can be specified directly using
  decimal digit string (for example "%10d"), or indirectly using an asterisk
  charcater (for example "%*.*f"). When using an asterisk, the next argument
  in the argument list (which must be an integer value) becomes the value
  that is actually used. For example "Format('%*.*f', [8, 2, 123.456])" is
  the same as "Format('%8.2f', [123.456])".

  A width specifier sets the minimum field width for a conversion. If the
  resulting string is shorter than the minimum field width, it is padded
  with blanks to increase the field width. The default is to right-justify
  the result by adding blanks in front of the value, but if the format
  specifier contains a left-justification indicator (a "-" character
  preceding the width specifier), the result is left-justified by adding
  blanks after the value.

  An index specifier sets the current argument list index to the specified
  value. The index of the first argument in the argument list is 0. Using
  index specifiers, it is possible to format the same argument multiple
  times. For example "Format('%d %d %0:d %d', [10, 20])" produces the string
  '10 20 10 20'.

  The Format function can be combined with other formatting functions. For
  example

    S := Format('Your total was %s on %s', [
      FormatFloat('$#,##0.00;;zero', Total),
      FormatDateTime('mm/dd/yy', Date)]);

  which uses the FormatFloat and FormatDateTime functions to customize the
  format beyond what is possible with Format. }

{ FloatToStrF converts the floating-point value given by Value to its string
  representation. The Format parameter controls the format of the resulting
  string. The Precision parameter specifies the precision of the given value.
  It should be 7 or less for values of type Single, 15 or less for values of
  type Double, and 18 or less for values of type Extended. The meaning of the
  Digits parameter depends on the particular format selected.

  The possible values of the Format parameter, and the meaning of each, are
  described below.

  ffGeneral - General number format. The value is converted to the shortest
  possible decimal string using fixed or scientific format. Trailing zeros
  are removed from the resulting string, and a decimal point appears only
  if necessary. The resulting string uses fixed point format if the number
  of digits to the left of the decimal point in the value is less than or
  equal to the specified precision, and if the value is greater than or
  equal to 0.00001. Otherwise the resulting string uses scientific format,
  and the Digits parameter specifies the minimum number of digits in the
  exponent (between 0 and 4).

  ffExponent - Scientific format. The value is converted to a string of the
  form "-d.ddd...E+dddd". The resulting string starts with a minus sign if
  the number is negative, and one digit always precedes the decimal point.
  The total number of digits in the resulting string (including the one
  before the decimal point) is given by the Precision parameter. The "E"
  exponent character in the resulting string is always followed by a plus
  or minus sign and up to four digits. The Digits parameter specifies the
  minimum number of digits in the exponent (between 0 and 4).

  ffFixed - Fixed point format. The value is converted to a string of the
  form "-ddd.ddd...". The resulting string starts with a minus sign if the
  number is negative, and at least one digit always precedes the decimal
  point. The number of digits after the decimal point is given by the Digits
  parameter--it must be between 0 and 18. If the number of digits to the
  left of the decimal point is greater than the specified precision, the
  resulting value will use scientific format.

  ffNumber - Number format. The value is converted to a string of the form
  "-d,ddd,ddd.ddd...". The ffNumber format corresponds to the ffFixed format,
  except that the resulting string contains thousand separators.

  ffCurrency - Currency format. The value is converted to a string that
  represents a currency amount. The conversion is controlled by the
  CurrencyString, CurrencyFormat, NegCurrFormat, ThousandSeparator, and
  DecimalSeparator global variables, all of which are initialized from
  locale settings provided by the operating system.  For example,
  Currency Format preferences can be set in the International section
  of the Windows Control Panel.
  The number of digits after the decimal point is given by the Digits
  parameter--it must be between 0 and 18.

  For all formats, the actual characters used as decimal and thousand
  separators are obtained from the DecimalSeparator and ThousandSeparator
  global variables.

  If the given value is a NAN (not-a-number), the resulting string is 'NAN'.
  If the given value is positive infinity, the resulting string is 'INF'. If
  the given value is negative infinity, the resulting string is '-INF'. }

  further details, see the description of the FloatToStrF function. }

function FloatToText(BufferArg: PChar; const Value; ValueType: TFloatValue;
  Format: TFloatFormat; Precision, Digits: Integer): Integer;

{ FormatFloat formats the floating-point value given by Value using the
  format string given by Format. The following format specifiers are
  supported in the format string:

  0     Digit placeholder. If the value being formatted has a digit in the
        position where the '0' appears in the format string, then that digit
        is copied to the output string. Otherwise, a '0' is stored in that
        position in the output string.

  #     Digit placeholder. If the value being formatted has a digit in the
        position where the '#' appears in the format string, then that digit
        is copied to the output string. Otherwise, nothing is stored in that
        position in the output string.

  .     Decimal point. The first '.' character in the format string
        determines the location of the decimal separator in the formatted
        value; any additional '.' characters are ignored. The actual
        character used as a the decimal separator in the output string is
        determined by the DecimalSeparator global variable, which is initialized
        from locale settings obtained from the operating system.

  ,     Thousand separator. If the format string contains one or more ','
        characters, the output will have thousand separators inserted between
        each group of three digits to the left of the decimal point. The
        placement and number of ',' characters in the format string does not
        affect the output, except to indicate that thousand separators are
        wanted. The actual character used as a the thousand separator in the
        output is determined by the ThousandSeparator global variable, which
        is initialized from locale settings obtained from the operating system.

  E+    Scientific notation. If any of the strings 'E+', 'E-', 'e+', or 'e-'
  E-    are contained in the format string, the number is formatted using
  e+    scientific notation. A group of up to four '0' characters can
  e-    immediately follow the 'E+', 'E-', 'e+', or 'e-' to determine the
        minimum number of digits in the exponent. The 'E+' and 'e+' formats
        cause a plus sign to be output for positive exponents and a minus
        sign to be output for negative exponents. The 'E-' and 'e-' formats
        output a sign character only for negative exponents.

  'xx'  Characters enclosed in single or double quotes are output as-is, and
  "xx"  do not affect formatting.

  ;     Separates sections for positive, negative, and zero numbers in the
        format string.

  The locations of the leftmost '0' before the decimal point in the format
  string and the rightmost '0' after the decimal point in the format string
  determine the range of digits that are always present in the output string.

  The number being formatted is always rounded to as many decimal places as
  there are digit placeholders ('0' or '#') to the right of the decimal
  point. If the format string contains no decimal point, the value being
  formatted is rounded to the nearest whole number.

  If the number being formatted has more digits to the left of the decimal
  separator than there are digit placeholders to the left of the '.'
  character in the format string, the extra digits are output before the
  first digit placeholder.

  To allow different formats for positive, negative, and zero values, the
  format string can contain between one and three sections separated by
  semicolons.

  One section - The format string applies to all values.

  Two sections - The first section applies to positive values and zeros, and
  the second section applies to negative values.

  Three sections - The first section applies to positive values, the second
  applies to negative values, and the third applies to zeros.

  If the section for negative values or the section for zero values is empty,
  that is if there is nothing between the semicolons that delimit the
  section, the section for positive values is used instead.

  If the section for positive values is empty, or if the entire format string
  is empty, the value is formatted using general floating-point formatting
  with 15 significant digits, corresponding to a call to FloatToStrF with
  the ffGeneral format. General floating-point formatting is also used if
  the value has more than 18 digits to the left of the decimal point and
  the format string does not specify scientific notation.

  The table below shows some sample formats and the results produced when
  the formats are applied to different values:

  Format string          1234        -1234       0.5         0
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

          the LongTimeFormat global variable. The time is not displayed if
          the fractional part of the DateTime value is zero.

  d       Displays the day as a number without a leading zero (1-31).

  dd      Displays the day as a number with a leading zero (01-31).

  ddd     Displays the day as an abbreviation (Sun-Sat) using the strings
          given by the ShortDayNames global variable.

  dddd    Displays the day as a full name (Sunday-Saturday) using the strings
          given by the LongDayNames global variable.

  ddddd   Displays the date using the format given by the ShortDateFormat
          global variable.

  dddddd  Displays the date using the format given by the LongDateFormat
          global variable.

  g       Displays the period/era as an abbreviation (Japanese and
          Taiwanese locales only).

  gg      Displays the period/era as a full name.

  e       Displays the year in the current period/era as a number without
          a leading zero (Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese locales only).

  ee      Displays the year in the current period/era as a number with
          a leading zero (Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese locales only).

  m       Displays the month as a number without a leading zero (1-12). If
          the m specifier immediately follows an h or hh specifier, the
          minute rather than the month is displayed.

  mm      Displays the month as a number with a leading zero (01-12). If
          the mm specifier immediately follows an h or hh specifier, the
          minute rather than the month is displayed.

  mmm     Displays the month as an abbreviation (Jan-Dec) using the strings
          given by the ShortMonthNames global variable.

  mmmm    Displays the month as a full name (January-December) using the
          strings given by the LongMonthNames global variable.

  yy      Displays the year as a two-digit number (00-99).

  yyyy    Displays the year as a four-digit number (0000-9999).

  h       Displays the hour without a leading zero (0-23).

  hh      Displays the hour with a leading zero (00-23).

  n       Displays the minute without a leading zero (0-59).

  nn      Displays the minute with a leading zero (00-59).

  s       Displays the second without a leading zero (0-59).

  ss      Displays the second with a leading zero (00-59).

  z       Displays the millisecond without a leading zero (0-999).

  zzz     Displays the millisecond with a leading zero (000-999).

  t       Displays the time using the format given by the ShortTimeFormat
          global variable.

  tt      Displays the time using the format given by the LongTimeFormat
          global variable.

  am/pm   Uses the 12-hour clock for the preceding h or hh specifier, and
          displays 'am' for any hour before noon, and 'pm' for any hour
          after noon. The am/pm specifier can use lower, upper, or mixed
          case, and the result is displayed accordingly.

  a/p     Uses the 12-hour clock for the preceding h or hh specifier, and
          displays 'a' for any hour before noon, and 'p' for any hour after
          noon. The a/p specifier can use lower, upper, or mixed case, and
          the result is displayed accordingly.

  ampm    Uses the 12-hour clock for the preceding h or hh specifier, and
          displays the contents of the TimeAMString global variable for any
          hour before noon, and the contents of the TimePMString global
          variable for any hour after noon.

  /       Displays the date separator character given by the DateSeparator
          global variable.

  :       Displays the time separator character given by the TimeSeparator
          global variable.

  'xx'    Characters enclosed in single or double quotes are displayed as-is,
  "xx"    and do not affect formatting.

  Format specifiers may be written in upper case as well as in lower case
  letters--both produce the same result.

  If the string given by the Format parameter is empty, the date and time
  value is formatted as if a 'c' format specifier had been given.

  The following example:

    S := FormatDateTime('"The meeting is on" dddd, mmmm d, yyyy, ' +
      '"at" hh:mm AM/PM', StrToDateTime('2/15/95 10:30am'));

  assigns 'The meeting is on Wednesday, February 15, 1995 at 10:30 AM' to
  the string variable S. }

{ IReadWriteSync is an abstract interface for general read/write synchronization.

{ TThreadLocalCounter

  This class implements a lightweight non-blocking thread local storage
  mechanism specifically built for tracking per-thread recursion counts
  in TMultiReadExclusiveWriteSynchronizer.  This class is intended for
  Delphi RTL internal use only.  In the future it may be generalized
  and "hardened" for general application use, but until then leave it alone.

  Rules of Use:
  The tls object must be opened to gain access to the thread-specific data
  structure.  If a threadinfo block does not exist for the current thread,
  Open will allocate one.  Every call to Open must be matched with a call
  to Close.  The pointer returned by Open is invalid after the matching call
  to Close.

  The thread info structure is unique to each thread.  Once you have it, it's
  yours.  You don't need to guard against concurrent access to the thread
  data by multiple threads - your thread is the only thread that will ever
  have access to the structure that Open returns.  The thread info structure
  is allocated and owned by the tls object.  If you put allocated pointers
  in the thread info make sure you free them before you delete the threadinfo
  node.

  When thread data is no longer needed, call the Delete method on the pointer.
  This must be done between calls to Open and Close.  Delete schedules the
  pointer for destruction, but the pointer (and its data) will still be
  valid until Close is called.

  Important:  Do not keep the tls object open for long periods of time.  The
  tls object performs internal cleanup only when no threads have the
  tls object in the open state.  In particular, be careful not to wait on
  a thread synchronization event or critical section while you
  have the tls object open.  It's much better to open and close the tls
  object before and after the blocking event than to leave the tls object
  open while waiting.

  Implementation Notes:
  The main purpose of this storage class is to provide thread-local storage
  without using limited / problematic OS tls slots and without requiring
  expensive blocking thread synchronization.  This class performs no
  blocking waits or spin loops!  (except for memory allocation)

  Thread info is kept in linked lists to facilitate non-blocking threading
  techniques.  A hash table indexed by a hash of the current thread ID
  reduces linear search times.

  When a node is deleted, it is moved out of the hash table lists into
  the purgatory list.  The hash table no longer points to the deleted node,
  but the deleted node's next pointer still points into the hash table.  This
  is so that deleting a node will not interrupt other threads that are
  traversing the list concurrent with the deletion.  If another thread is
  visiting a node while it is being deleted, the thread will follow the
  node's next pointer and get back into the live list without interruption.

  The purgatory list is linked through the nodes' NextDead field.  Again, this
  is to preserve the exit path of other threads still visiting the deleted
  node.

  When the last concurrent use of the tls object is closed (when FOpenCount
  drops to zero), all nodes in the purgatory list are reviewed for destruction
  or recycling. It's safe to do this without a thread synchronization lock
  because we know there are no threads visiting any of the nodes.  Newly
  deleted nodes are cleared of their thread identity and assigned a clock tick
  expiration value.  If a deleted node has been in the purgatory for longer
  than the holding period, Close will free the node.  When Open needs to
  allocate a new node for a new thread, it first tries to recycle an old node
  from the purgatory.  If nothing is available for recycling, Open allocates
  new memory.  The default holding period is one minute.

  Note that nodes enter the holding pattern when the tls object is closed.
  They won't be reviewed for destruction until the *next* time the tls
  object transitions into the closed state.  This is intentional, to
  reduce memory allocation thrashing when multiple threads open, delete,
  and close tls frequently, as will be the case with non-recursive read
  locks in TMREWSync.

  Close grabs the purgatory list before checking the FOpenCount to avoid
  race conditions with other threads reopening the tls while Close is
  executing.  If FOpenCount is not yet zero, Close has to put the purgatory
  list back together (Reattach), including any items added to the
  purgatory list after Close swiped it.  Since the number of thread
  participants should be small (less than 32) and the frequency of deletions
  relative to thread data access should be low, the purgatory list should
  never grow large enough to make this non-blocking Close implementation a
  performance problem.

  The linked list management relies heavily on InterlockedExchange to perform
  atomic node pointer replacements.  There are brief windows of time where
  the linked list may be circular while a two-step insertion takes place.
  During that brief window, other threads traversing the lists may see
  the same node more than once more than once. (pun!) This is fine for what this
  implementation needs.  Don't do anything silly like try to count the
  nodes during a traversal.

{ TMultiReadExclusiveWriteSynchronizer minimizes thread serialization to gain
  read access to a resource shared among threads while still providing complete
  exclusivity to callers needing write access to the shared resource.
  (multithread shared reads, single thread exclusive write)
  Read locks are allowed while owning a write lock.
  Read locks can be promoted to write locks within the same thread.
  (BeginRead, BeginWrite, EndWrite, EndRead)

  Note: Other threads have an opportunity to modify the protected resource
  when you call BeginWrite before you are granted the write lock, even
  if you already have a read lock open.  Best policy is not to retain
  any info about the protected resource (such as count or size) across a
  write lock.  Always reacquire samples of the protected resource after
  acquiring or releasing a write lock.

  The function result of BeginWrite indicates whether another thread got
  the write lock while the current thread was waiting for the write lock.
  Return value of True means that the write lock was acquired without
  any intervening modifications by other threads.  Return value of False
  means another thread got the write lock while you were waiting, so the
  resource protected by the MREWS object should be considered modified.
  Any samples of the protected resource should be discarded.

  In general, it's better to just always reacquire samples of the protected
  resource after obtaining a write lock.  The boolean result of BeginWrite
  and the RevisionLevel property help cases where reacquiring the samples
  is computationally expensive or time consuming.

  RevisionLevel changes each time a write lock is granted.  You can test
  RevisionLevel for equality with a previously sampled value of the property
  to determine if a write lock has been granted, implying that the protected
  resource may be changed from its state when the original RevisionLevel
  value was sampled.  Do not rely on the sequentiality of the current
  RevisionLevel implementation (it will wrap around to zero when it tops out).
  Do not perform greater than / less than comparisons on RevisionLevel values.
  RevisionLevel indicates only the stability of the protected resource since
  your original sample.  It should not be used to calculate how many
  revisions have been made.
